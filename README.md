This resource pack improves color maps for Minecraft biomes, making her more beautiful, or as I call it, the spring of color, while the default color map is similar to arid summer.

This resource pack is also compatible with Faithful and should work with any other resource pack if you put Beautiful Colormap at the top of the resource pack list in the Minecraft settings.

It should also support almost all versions of Minecraft. If not, let me know.
